# New Moon – Project Method (Non-Negotiable)

## Core Principle

This project is developed as a Website-as-a-System, not pages.

## Working Method

1. Audit before design
2. Structure before visuals
3. Decision support over decoration
4. Product thinking over features
5. Execution only after alignment

## Current Phase

Sprint A – Visual & Decision WOW
Focus:

- Solutions section
- Hero presence
- Studio entry framing

## Solutions Rules

- Exactly 3 cards (fixed)
- No product listings
- No prices
- No store logic
- Each card is a decision gateway

## Motion Rules

- Subtle only
- Hover-based
- No flashy effects
- Premium B2B feel

## Forbidden

- Removing existing content without reason
- Redesigning without purpose
- Generic UI suggestions
- Skipping analysis

Any output ignoring this method is invalid.
